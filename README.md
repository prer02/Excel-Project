# *Overview:*

Welcome to the Bank Loan Summary project! This repository contains code and documentation related to the analysis of a bank dataset, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for understanding and optimizing the bank's loan operations. The primary goal is to provide valuable insights that will aid the bank in making informed decisions to enhance profitability.

## Project Description:

# *Purpose:*

The purpose of this project is to analyze a bank's loan dataset and derive meaningful KPIs that can guide decision-making processes. By examining critical metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Fund Amount, Total Amount Received, and Average Interest Rate, the project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the bank's loan portfolio.

# *Key Features:*

Total Loan Applications: The count of all loan applications received by the bank, providing insight into the demand for loans.

Total Fund Amount: The aggregate amount of funds requested by applicants, giving an overview of the financial needs of the customer base.

Total Amount Received: The sum of the actual funds received by the bank, offering a clear picture of the bank's liquidity.

Average Interest Rate: Calculated as the mean interest rate across all loan applications, helping to understand the overall pricing strategy and risk assessment.

Check the generated reports and Dashboards for insights into the bank's loan portfolio.
